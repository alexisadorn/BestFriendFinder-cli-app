# BestFriendFinder

BestFriendFinder helps you find your new best friend by displaying animals that are available for adoption
at the Best Friend Animals Society's sanctuary in Kanab, UT. Help millions of homeless animals by choosing to
'#AdoptDontShop'.

BestFriendFinder will list available dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, horses, pigs, barnyard and small & furry animals.
You can learn more about the animal right here in the BestFriendFinder app, or copy/paste the link in your browser
to find out how to adopt!
