# BestFriendFinder

BestFriendFinder helps you find your new best friend by displaying animals that are available for adoption
at the [Best Friend Animals Society](http://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary)'s sanctuary in Kanab, UT. Help millions of homeless animals by choosing to
'#AdoptDontShop'.

BestFriendFinder lists available dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, horses, pigs, barnyard and small & furry animals.
You can learn more about the animal right here in the BestFriendFinder app, or copy/paste the link in your browser
